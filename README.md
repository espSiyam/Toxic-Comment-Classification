# Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification

This is a kaggle competetion hosted by Jigsaw and google to identify toxic comments in online conversations. This is a addition to the previous Toxic Comment Classification Challenge which is to be more unbiased and diverse.
## Description

In this competition, you're challenged to build a model that recognizes toxicity and minimizes this type of unintended bias with respect to mentions of identities. You'll be using a dataset labeled for identity mentions and optimizing a metric designed to measure unintended bias. Develop strategies to reduce unintended bias in machine learning models, and you'll help the Conversation AI team, and the entire industry, build models that work well for a wide range of conversations.
